        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is the best Pad Thai recipe ever. 
            My father's Pad Thai is better than most Thai restaurants! 
            I like it because of all the fresh ingredients, it is not greasy. 
            It's satisfying and healthy. There is no meat in this recipe.</p>
